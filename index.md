The importance of late 19th century literature in shaping today's Scandinavian cultures and
societies is acknowledged by scholars, but the investigation of its radical nature has been limited to
few, selected works. Conversely, computational semantics
enjoys a large quantity of textual resources, but those are mostly in English, and are accompanied
by only shallow annotation. We draw on literary and linguistic/nlp expertise to parse a
first-of-its-kind historical Scandinavian corpus, consisting of 895 Danish and Norwegian novels, with
rich semantic information, advancing both parsing technology with the use of high-quality linguistic
resources as well as our historical understanding of the texts. The proposed methodology for
detecting linguistic and cultural change is translatable and can be applied in other domains.
We propose a new way of studying literary change over time, and develop an
innovative methodology for digital literary studies by advancing relation extraction by broad-coverage semantic parsing,
anchored locally and historically with the help of unique linguistic and conceptual resources and language technology.

- [The Unhappy Texts](https://github.com/mime-memo/unhappy). This term is rooted in a literary hypothesis that suggests 19th-century Scandinavian texts written by female authors were characterized by a negative sentiment, reflecting the societal constraints and patriarchal norms that women faced during this era. The authors of these texts often depicted characters who lacked agency and were disillusioned, reflecting their own experiences in a restrictive society. However, it's important to note that this hypothesis is based on a limited selection of texts and is subject to ongoing analysis and interpretation. The use of sentiment analysis tools and methodologies, such as those developed for the analysis of historical Danish and Norwegian literary texts, can provide a more nuanced understanding of these 'unhappy texts' and the societal conditions they reflect

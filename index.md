Mining the Meaning (MiMe) is a project financed by the University of Copenhagen Data+ grant that aims to explore the literary and social modernization of Scandinavian societies during the latter part of the 19th century. Unlike traditional historiography, MiMe employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and semantic analysis to examine a broad corpus of 895 Danish and Norwegian novels published between 1870 and 1900. The project's methodology includes developing state-of-the-art computational semantic methods and training large language models towards written late 19th-century Danish and Norwegian. The project also plans to integrate existing conceptual knowledge resources and develop methods for incorporating extra-linguistic information in semantic parsing and analysis.

The MiMe project is closely related to the [Measuring Modernity (MeMo)](https://nors.ku.dk/english/research/projects/measuring-modernity/) project financed by the Carlsberg Foundation, but the two have distinct focuses. While both initiatives explore the reflections of societal change in Scandinavian literature from the same historical period, MeMo primarily focuses on the literary analysis research, investigating how Denmark and Scandinavia became modern and the role of literature in that process. On the other hand, MiMe is more oriented towards the development of computational methodology, aiming to create a higher level of abstraction in text analysis, enabling a fine-grained but large-scale investigation of various phenomena. Both projects, however, share the common goal of offering new insights into the processes of modernization in this formative period in the literary and social history of Scandinavia.

# Sub-projects
- [The Unhappy Texts](https://github.com/mime-memo/unhappy). This term is rooted in a literary hypothesis that suggests 19th-century Scandinavian texts written by female authors were characterized by a negative sentiment, reflecting the societal constraints and patriarchal norms that women faced during this era. The authors of these texts often depicted characters who lacked agency and were disillusioned, reflecting their own experiences in a restrictive society. However, it's important to note that this hypothesis is based on a limited selection of texts and is subject to ongoing analysis and interpretation. The use of sentiment analysis tools and methodologies, such as those developed for the analysis of historical Danish and Norwegian literary texts, can provide a more nuanced understanding of these 'unhappy texts' and the societal conditions they reflect
